                    <h2>Facts About Harry Potter</h2>
                    <p>
                        With over 600 million copies sold worldwide, Harry Potter is the bestselling book series in history. But the wizarding
                        world of Harry Potter is so much more than just books or a movie series or a franchise.

                        For many fans, it's an actual world that they can escape to when reading or watching. There is so much going on in the
                        Harry Potter world, actually, that it can be hard to keep track of all the little details. In fact, there are lots of
                        fun trivia questions and facts about Harry Potter and the wizarding world that even some of the biggest fans aren't
                        aware of. They add an extra layer of fascination to the stories and, if possible, make J.K. Rowling's made-up world even
                        better. Here's a look at some facts about Harry Potter you probably didn't know.
